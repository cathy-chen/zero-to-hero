# Introduction to Design & Bootstrap basics
In this repository, you will find relevant files for the Intro to Design + Bootstrap Basics workshop as a part of the Zero to Hero series run by Hack Western.

In the resources folder, you will find the slides from today, as well as any miscellaneous items.

The other portion of this repository will be the Github Pages (gh-pages) branch, which will serve as a basis for our Bootstrap portion.

If you have any questions before or after the workshop, feel free to contact me at *cathy@hackwestern.com*.
